# TEST SEEZONA

### Deploy [visit site (can build if state was sleep, need a little time)](https://seezona2-hfagjdrakx.now.sh/)

### Git repo [https://github.com/Alexzanderk/Seezona_v2](https://github.com/Alexzanderk/Seezona_v2)

What you need to do? Add few cities, because some element displayed when you add few elements

Notes:

1. React v16.8.0-alpha.1 with Hooks
2. Used Material-UI
3. Used redux selectors, configure store
4. All actions and reducers stay in store folder it's not so big project to use one of the best practice
5. I create API class and export instance to easy use requests
6. Used Promise and async await to show that I can
7. NO remove logger you can open browser console to see actions and state(redux store)
8. Create dynamic head tittle - look on browser tab
9. Auto check I set on 10 seconds
10. I didn't have enough time to read normalizr 😔
11. I didn't have enough time write all tests 😔
12. I didn't have enough time create component to show Error 😔
13. I didn't have enough time to deep refactoring 😔
